# Sprint 1 Planning

## Sprint Goal

The goal of Sprint 2 is to implement the following main features:
- Updating user profiles (CAR-3, CAR-18)
- Vendors posting listings for sale or rent (CAR-19, CAR-21)
- Users seeing listings (CAR-5, CAR-7
- Vendors deleting listings (CAR-24)
- Vendors updating listings (CAR-20, CAR-23)


This would allow our application to work in terms of posting, updarting and deleting from the vendor side, and viewing from customer side. Users interacting with listings will be addressed in sprint 3.

**The total amount of Story Points estimated for this sprint are 243**

The user stories have been listed below in terms of priority and the order in which they will be addressed.

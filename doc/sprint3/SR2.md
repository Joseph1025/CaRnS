### What are practices that you should continue during next sprint
- Good use of gitflow to prevent errors when we merged.
- Assigning tasks on Trello was done better than Sprint 1. Each member knew what was assigned to them and was able to work on the task independently.

### What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint 
- Manage exceptations and prioritize Trello tasks (with midterms and A1), so we're all on the same page. Put our energy on the same tasks so they get completed.
- Frontend reuse former packages/dependencies to avoid missing components during merge (like in Sprint 2).
- Splitting stories into frontend and backend on Trello and moving them when finished instead of at the end of the sprint.

### What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint 
- Not all frontend packages were consistent across components, which caused some issues during merge.
- Most of our work was commited within the last few days before the deadline causing some stress when attempting to bugfix.

### What was your best/worst experience during sprint 2 
**Best**
- After the bugs were fixed, the product in dev felt high quality.
- Learning new things.

**Worst**
- Overload on second week. Too much.
- Merging the form didn't work initially.

This website provides car rental services in many cities in Canada. It provides a wide range of vehicle to choose, and flexibility to choose when and where to return the vehicle. Since its service is driven by company, the cost is high daily, and no space to bargain the price.

## Our difference with competitors

###  Potential users of our application
A potential vendor would own some vehicles, but wants to rent one and sell one. One platform would save the vendor a lot of effort to manage things.

A potential user would be relatively budget tight and cost-sensitive, so he/she is not sure whether to buy a car or rent one. Our platfrom provides all kinds of choices in the same place.

### Edges over competitors
Our application provide a common space for vendors looking to sell and rent their idling vehicles out. Therefore, with this flexibilty for vendors, we can in turn provide more choice for users who are not certain whether to buy or rent one. 
Our platform is relatively integrated than competitors, so users and vendors can save a lot of trouble and effort.

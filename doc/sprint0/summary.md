# Summary - CaRnS 
*Car Rent 'n' Sell*

## **Project Objective**  

CaRnS is a web peer-to-peer vehicle sharing application and marketplace. Our objective is to offer a platform to vehicle owners to buy, rent, sell or share *any* vehicles (predominantly cars, hence the name). The web application displays listings of the desired vehicle type the user wants to rent/buy in the city of their choice. In addition, it provides a means to contact and schedule a vehicle pick-up with vendors at a desired cost and location. Users will also be able to create listings for any vehicle they wish to sell or rent out. 


## **Key Users**  
- Buyer &rarr; A user who uses the platform to buy one or more vehicles.

- Renter &rarr; A user who rents out a vehicle from a vendor on the platform.

- Vendor &rarr; A user who creates listings and either sells vehicles to buyers or allows renters to rent out their vehicles. 


## **Usage Scenarios/Personas**
Mike Zack, a 29 year-old investor, needs a means of visiting startups before choosing to invest into them after his car stopping functioning properly. While he finds public transportation inconvenient, he realizes that taxis and car rentals are expensive. He wants a platform to buy a second-hand car at a decent price in good condition and communicate with car owners before making his purchase decision.

Tiina Ashly, a 27 year-old software developer, works from home and owns two cars. She is considering selling one of her two cars and renting out the other as they are rarely used. She needs a platform to communicate with buyers and renters to ensure her vehicles are in the right hands.

Fern Gabdon, a 37 year-old construction worker, likes to travel a lot with his family although their family is not wealthy. He's looking for a large SUV, however, is not pleased with current renting platforms as they don't give him the agency to choose the make, model and colour of the vehicle he rents. He is looking for more control in choosing a suitable car for the travel at a good price.  


## **Key Principles**
Quality: We strive to give users a responsive, efficient and well-constructed platform, as well as ensuring that users find the vehicles they request in good condition. 

Ease-of-use & convenience: A central aspect of any marketplace is that it should be effortless to exchange goods and seamless for both buyers and sellers to integrate into their daily schedules.

Flexibility: Whether a user wants to rent a mini-van for a family weekend road trip, spontaneously buy a bike to help them get back into shape or rent out their Tesla for a month, CaRnS gives users the opportunity to schedule pick-ups for any vehicle they access or market.

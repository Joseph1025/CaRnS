# Sprint 0 Reflection

1. **How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any?**

We organized our team through Discord and Whatsapp. 
In our first meeting, we assigned a deliverable to each person. We also created a discord channel for each deliverable to organize our communication.

2. **How did you make decisions?**

Communicating as a group and looking for general consensus. 

3. **How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting (on
average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?**

Story point estimation was done using the fibbonaci scale. Once the voting was complete, team members discussed the outcome and come to a consensus. This was accomplished in two rounds of voting.

Priority was voted on by team members on a scale of 1-5, with 1 being the highest priority. After the first round of voting, team members discussed the outcome and came to a consensus. 

1. **How frequently did you meet?**

Every 3 days and communicated daily on discord.

5. **What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?**

Dividing work and communicating regularly helps keep everyone engaged and productive. Having a channel for each deliverable also organized our communication to be focused on one task at a time.
